# TMcraft_Packer
TMcraft Packer is a tool for the packaging process of TMcraft plugins. After developers finish building the TMcraft plugin program, it required a packaging process before usage on TMflow:
- For TMcraft Node, Toolbar and Setup, TMcraft Packer will first generate the corresponding execution files from their User Control Library files.
- In addition, TMcraft Packer will also generate an Installation Code and a con-figuration file that represent the TMcraft plugin. Then, the system will package the TMcraft plugin exe-cution file and all related files into a zip file.

For more detail, please refer to ***TMcraft Packer Software Manual***.
